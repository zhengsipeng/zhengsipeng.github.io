# Sipeng Zheng

## A short introduction
I am an engineer, hydro-climatologist and researcher. My research focuses on drought detection and attribution, as well as prediction using GCM simulations. I mainly use statistical tools to carry out my research works.

PROFILE:
* Highly self-motivated researcher with demonstrated research expertise modeling hydro-climatology processes. 
* Strong interpersonal skills with a good sense of teamwork.
* Programming Skills: R, C/C++, and Python in both Unix and Windows environments.
* Rich experience in modeling and GIS, using MIKE, SWMM, DSSAT, and QGIS.
