## A short introduction
Ze Jiang is a research associate from the University of New South Wales who specializes in the field of hydro-climatology. His research is centered on understanding the impact of climate change on the water cycle, specifically investigating the effects of global warming on droughts and floods. Ze received his PhD in Water Resources Engineering from UNSW, where he developed an incredibly cool method known as Wavelet System Prediction (WASP), capable of predicting sustained hydro-climate changes. Ze's academic journey started with a B.Eng in Environmental Engineering from Hohai University, China. He then pursued a Joint M.Sc in "EuroAquae - HydroInformatics and Water Management" under the partnership of five European universities. Before relocating to Australia, Ze worked at the National University of Singapore, where he contributed to hydrological and crop modeling for two years.

<b>Research Highlights:</b>
* Development of [spectral transformation](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026962) and its [application](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126816) in hydro-climatology
* An [open-source tool](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WASP/index.html) for improved system modelling: [Wavelet System Prediction (WASP)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104907)
* Development of a [postprocessing method](https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-22-0217.1) and [software](https://zejiang-unsw.github.io/software/WQM/) for correcting bias in Numerical Weather Predictions in the time-frequency domain
* Quantification of future changes in [drought](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022EF003350) and [agricultural production](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00704-018-2617-z) under global warming
* Development of [index-based drought insurance](https://doi.org/10.1108/AFR-02-2020-0020) for disaster risk transfer
