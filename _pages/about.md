This is Sipeng Zheng's personal homepage. 

## A short introduction
I'm Sipeng Zheng, a researcher affiliated with the Multimodal Interaction Research Group at the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence(BAAI), , where I collaborate with Prof. Zongqing Lu. 
I obtained my PhD and bachelor degree from Renmin University of China (RUC), under the guidance of Prof. Qin Jin. 
My primary research focus revolves around human behavior understanding, vision-and-language learning, and embodied artificial intelligence.
I am particularly interested in various tasks such as visual relation detection, scene graph generation, action recognition, open-world agent planning, and more.
