## DSSAT crop modeling of future rice yield in Vietnam under climate change, Singapore-MIT Alliance project.

Study the link of future climate changes and its impacts rice crop productivity over Vietnam. The study applied climate outputs at high resolution from a regional climate model (i.e., WRF) as inputs to the DSSAT crop modelling system. Projected future rice yield and food security risk map are simulated and generated.

## Development of index-based drought insurance for sovereign disaster risk transfer, World Bank project. 

Examine the usability of rainfall and temperature outputs of a regional climate model (RCM) and meteorological drought indices to develop a macro-level risk transfer product to compensate the government of Central Java, Indonesia, for drought-related disaster payments to rice farmers.
