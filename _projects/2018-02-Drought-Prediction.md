Hydro-climatologists rely on general circulation models (GCMs) to understand the risk of future droughts due to human-induced climate change. However, GCMs have varying abilities to represent these sustained hydro-climatological anomalies due to their coarse resolutions and parametrizations leading to considerable uncertainty and biases at a range of time scales. Therefore, there are still research gaps in GCM-based assessments of hydro-climatological changes. As such, the primary aims of this project include: 

* Identifying the role of uncertainty and bias in detecting historical climate change; 

* Improving the representation of low-frequency variability of hydro-climatological anomalies, such as sustained droughts.
